TODO

Writing a suitably showy test script.

Windows support

Enabling GraphicsMagick support... have to wait until the GraphicsMagick
MagickWand API catches up to the ImageMagick original.

Testing, lots of testing.

Writing PHP-centric documentation.

Improving source documentation.

Verifying function prototypes in source.

Finishing PHP5 class-based interface (very cool -- stay tuned)
